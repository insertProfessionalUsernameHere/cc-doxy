# cc-doxy
A short emacs yasnippet for automatic doxygen function comment generation 

Requirements: Emacs, Yasnippet, Semantic-mode.

Simply place in "~/.emacs.d/el-get/yasnippet/snippets/cc-mode/" or your system equivalent, then "M-x yas-reload-all", and you're all set!

This implementation was taken from here:

https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/8006/is-there-a-yasnippet-producing-a-prepopulated-doxygen-comment

and modified further to fix bugs I encountered and fit the output to my particular style.
